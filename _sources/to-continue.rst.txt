To continue: course development ideas/topics
============================================

Additional topics:
 * select command
 * revise coreutils section, expand the examples and explanations, make it clear 
   that BASH is about getting those small utilities to work together
 * benchmark: C-code vs BASH, Python vs BASH, Perl vs BASH

Ideas for exercises
-------------------
 * function to find all broken links
 * (homework?) Implement a profiler, that summarizes PS4/date output mentioned above
 * (homework?) Script that makes 'pe1 pe2 ... gpu32' out of 'pe[1-16],gpu11,gpu32'

In general, there could one script that one starts building from the first line up to
a parallelization. Like backup script with rsync.

Git usage?
